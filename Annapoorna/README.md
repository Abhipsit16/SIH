# 🌾 Agri-Vision-AI

## 🚀 Mission

Agri-Vision-AI is built to empower the agricultural community by leveraging artificial intelligence for early, accessible, and accurate **crop disease detection**. The goal is to:

-  Improve **crop yield**
-  Minimize **pesticide misuse**
-  Promote **sustainable farming practices**

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **Disease Classification Model**  
  Develop a high-performance deep learning model to classify crop diseases from plant images.

- **User-Friendly Interface**  
  Build an intuitive platform allowing users to upload images for disease prediction.

- **LLM-Based Treatment Guidance**  
  Integrate a language model to provide reliable and personalized treatment suggestions based on detected diseases.

- **Inclusive Interaction**  
  Support **multilingual** and **voice-based** inputs to ensure accessibility across user demographics.

- **Real-World Scalability**  
  Optimize the system for robustness, efficiency, and deployment in diverse agricultural settings.

## 📊 Datasets Utilized

To ensure wide coverage of crop types and disease scenarios, we curated a diverse dataset by merging and processing multiple sources:

### 📁 1. [20K Multi-Class Crop Disease Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jawadali1045/20k-multi-class-crop-disease-images)
- Multi-crop dataset with real-world variations and multiple disease categories.

### 📁 2. [Plant Village Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)
- A standardized and widely used benchmark dataset for training and validation.

### 📁 3. [PlantDoc Dataset](https://github.com/pratikkayal/PlantDoc-Dataset)
- Realistic field images with complex backgrounds and natural lighting, ideal for generalization.

### 📁 4. [Identification of Plant Leaf Diseases Using a 9-layer Deep Convolutional Neural Network](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tywbtsjrjv/1)  

### 🧪 Final Unified Dataset Composition
- 🔢 **77 disease classes**
- 🖼️ ~**1,290 images per class**
- 🔁 Includes **augmentation and preprocessing** for consistency and robustness
